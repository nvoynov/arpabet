# Arpabet

This gem provides a method of getting an IPA transcription for [ARPABET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPABET) phonemes. The reason this gem was born - to prepare CMUDict with transcriptions instead of phonemes set, so than only English phonemes supported at the moment.

It splits input phonemes into syllables and when there is a stressed vowel inside it places stress before the syllable. Syllabification is based on "A Rule Based Algorithm for Automatic Syllabification of a Word of Bodo".

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'arpabet'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install arpabet

## Usage

```ruby
require 'arpabet'
Arpabet.transcription(%w(AE2 B ER0 K R AA1 M B IY0))
```

## Development
